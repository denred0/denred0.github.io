I know that there is a lot I don’t know, so I always strive to learn, discover new things, and improve on what I already know.
I have several areas of personal development that strengthen and support me.

<h4>My hobbies, interests, and life outside of work:</h4>

	<dt>Working with a Personal Psychologist</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I’ve prioritized this because the work I do in therapy has the most significant impact on both my life and my work. Working with a psychologist helps me eliminate internal limitations and prevents me from wasting energy and strength on unnecessary worries and fears.</p>

	<dt>Personal Projects</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I have a personal project—<a href="https://t.me/everyone_ai_channel">a Telegram bot</a> for generating images and avatars. Currently, I'm actively improving my development skills, and this project serves as an excellent platform to experiment with new approaches and ideas, while honing my ability to build good application architecture.</p>
