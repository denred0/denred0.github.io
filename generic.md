I know that there is a lot I don’t know, so I always strive to learn, discover new things, and improve on what I already know.
I have several areas of personal development that strengthen and support me.

<h4>My hobbies, interests, and life outside of work:</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Working with a Personal Psychologist</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I’ve prioritized this because the work I do in therapy has the most significant impact on both my life and my work. Working with a psychologist helps me eliminate internal limitations and prevents me from wasting energy and strength on unnecessary worries and fears.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Personal Projects</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I have a personal project—<a href="https://t.me/everyone_ai_channel">a Telegram bot</a> for generating images and avatars. Currently, I'm actively improving my development skills, and this project serves as an excellent platform to experiment with new approaches and ideas, while honing my ability to build good application architecture.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>English</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I have two English lessons per week with a teacher. Additionally, I've started using ChatGPT Voice Mode as a conversation partner for extra practice.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Touch typing</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I practice touch typing for 10 minutes every day. I've already reached a good typing speed for English, and recently, I added the Russian keyboard layout to my training to master touch typing speed for both layouts.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Sport</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I spend a lot of time sitting, so staying active is very important to me. I try to attend boxing and Muay Thai classes three times a week, and I also do stretching at home.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Pumping up programming</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I started actively using ChatGPT for learning, and it pointed out that there’s a lot I don’t know and many areas to develop in programming. I try to find time to study new Python concepts and apply them to my work. To keep the learned information structured, I created <a href="https://t.me/everyone_ai_channel">a Telegram channel</a> https://t.me/pythonshots  where I make notes on the topics I study.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>AI Channels</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I strive to stay up to date with the latest advancements in neural networks, so I’m subscribed to about two dozen channels dedicated to neural networks. When I come across a useful tool related to a topic (such as image generation, 3D, or LLMs), I save it in a separate chat to use in my work later.</p>
